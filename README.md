My Take on the DataCamp Project "67 years of Lego"

### Important info about the notebook

You must download the notebook in order to see the Plotly graphs, somehow the Github preview does not show them. Same goes for some of the images

As stated this is just my take (plus some additions) on the Datacamp project "67 years of LEGO"
